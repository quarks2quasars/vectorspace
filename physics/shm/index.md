# Module: Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM)
**Level:** Grade 11 / High School Physics

Simple Harmonic Motion is the foundation for understanding everything from clock pendulums to the vibration of atoms in a solid. In this module, we break down complex oscillations into easy-to-digest parts.

## 🚀 Interactive Exploration
Before you start the lessons, play with our simulation to get a "feel" for how mass and spring constants change the speed of an oscillation.
